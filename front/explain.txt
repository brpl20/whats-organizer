The key change here is in the artifacts section. I've changed baseDirectory: dist to baseDirectory: build. However, you should verify the correct output directory for your specific Svelte project setup:

Check your Svelte configuration file (usually vite.config.js or svelte.config.js) for the build output directory.
If you can't find it specified there, run a local build (pnpm run build) and see which directory is created with the build output.
Update the baseDirectory in the amplify.yml to match your project's actual build output directory.

Common possibilities include:

build
public
dist

After making this change:

Commit and push the updated amplify.yml file to your repository.
Trigger a new build in Amplify.

This should resolve the "Artifact directory doesn't exist" error. If you encounter any further issues, please provide:

The relevant part of your Svelte configuration file (vite.config.js or svelte.config.js)
The new build logs if the error persists

With this information, I can provide more targeted assistance.
